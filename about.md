# About Me

I hold a background in Econometrics and Economics, fields that blend quantitative analysis, statistical methods, and economic theories to evaluate and interpret data. My journey into Data Science and Machine Learning is driven by my passion for understanding complex systems and leveraging data to make informed decisions.

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning:** Building predictive models to solve real-world problems, from forecasting to classification tasks.

- **Data Science:** Extracting valuable insights from large and complex datasets, combining my understanding of economics to inform strategy and decision-making.

- **Econometric Modeling:** Using statistical techniques to analyze economic data and predict future trends.
  
  
## My Skillset

- **Programming**: Highly proficient in programming languages like R, Python, and SQL, essential for tasks ranging from data manipulation to machine learning implementation.

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Skilled in using libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and well-versed in data analysis techniques from descriptive statistics to complex statistical tests.

- **Machine Learning**: Strong understanding of a wide array of machine learning algorithms, from classical methods to modern machine learning techniques, supported by proficiency in libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

- **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Experienced in preprocessing and cleaning data to prepare it for analysis or machine learning models, including handling missing data, feature transformation, and other data manipulation tasks.

- **Data Visualization**: Proficient in data visualization tools and libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, able to clearly and effectively communicate findings through visual means.

- **Statistical Modeling/Econometrics**: Specialized in Bayesian econometrics and time-series forecasting, with a comprehensive understanding of hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probabilistic models.
